## Overview

**What The Fed?** was developed as part of my senior year AP Government and Politics Civic Project in the first semester of 2024. It is also my first major Flutter application, designed to enhance civic literacy and engagement by leveraging AI to make government actions more accessible and transparent.

Public engagement in democracy is crucial, yet participation has been declining, as evidenced by low voter turnout and waning trust in government institutions. Many citizens feel disconnected from the political process, a trend that threatens the strength of democracy.

**What The Fed?** aims to bridge this gap by providing easy-to-understand legislative updates. Using AI, the platform gathers information from sources like the daily Congressional Record and recently proposed legislation, distilling it into clear, digestible summaries. Users can track congressional debates, legislative developments, and floor proceedings while interacting with an AI assistant to deepen their understanding of federal actions.

This is a **prototype application and demonstration**, exploring AI’s potential in promoting civic engagement and making government information more accessible.
