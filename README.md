## Overview

What The Fed? was created as part of my senior year AP Government and Politics Civic Project for the first semester of 2024. This project is dedicated to increasing civic literacy and engagement by leveraging AI to make government actions more accessible and transparent. This is a **prototype application and demonstration** to explore the potential of AI-powered civic engagement tools.  


In America’s democracy, strong civic engagement is a must. However, in recent years, public involvement in our government has been steadily declining, as evidenced by low voter turnout and plummeting approval ratings. Many citizens feel disconnected from and wary of their government, a concerning trend for the health of our democracy.

**What The Fed?** aims to reverse this trend by making government legislation and actions truly accessible and understandable to the everyday citizen. By leveraging AI, What The Fed? compiles information from sources like the daily Congressional Record and the latest legislation, summarizing it into clear, digestible insights. Users can rapidly catch up on the latest debates, proceedings, and legislative actions in Congress through AI-generated summaries and interactive conversations that help build a deeper understanding of federal government activities.

## Features

- **Stay in the Know**: Follow Congress's daily activities, including floor proceedings, debates, proposed legislation, and votes, all summarized with AI. Track bills as they move through Congress and understand the decisions your representatives are making.
- **Bill Tracking**: Stay updated on new and pending legislation with clear, concise summaries of their potential impact.
- **Conversational AI**: Interact with an AI assistant to ask questions and gain deeper insights into government actions and policies, moving beyond the text to their deeper impact.

## Why It Matters

In a time when government transparency is more crucial than ever, What The Fed? bridges the gap between complex government proceedings and public understanding. By simplifying legislative information, the platform empowers citizens to engage meaningfully with political discourse, hold elected officials accountable, and make informed decisions.

Understanding government actions shouldn’t require a law degree. **What The Fed?** ensures that citizens—regardless of political knowledge—have the tools to stay informed. Our goal is to increase civic literacy, encourage meaningful discussions, and empower citizens to actively participate in democracy.
